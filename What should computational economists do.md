##  What Should (Computational) Economists Do?

   ###    In January 1964,  James M Buchanan wrote an book " What should economists do?".In his book he 

###    rejected the familiar proposition advanced by Jacob Viner that "economics is what economists do " and 

###    suggested that economists should place more attention on "the theory of markets" and not "the theory of

###    resource allocation". He advocated that economists should be market economists and they should focus 

###    more on the " a particular form of human activity and upon the various arrangement that arise as a 

###    results of this form of activity". However, everyone has different opinions on this questions. Andrew 

###    Haldane, the chief economist at the bank of england, said that the economists are just like the weather 

###    forcaster. But if economists are like forecasters, they should put more effort on the forcasting. 

###    Meteorologists' jobs are difficult but  meteorologists do their job really well--thanks in part to 500,000 

###    times everydays' weather measurements and powerful supercomputers' simulations. Perhaps 

###    economists should use this approach to forcast and analyze the economic market.  Therefore, with the 

###    development of the computer technology, a new industry generated--Computation Economics. 

### What is computational economics? What are computational economists doing ? What should they be 

### doing?  In general, computaional economics is the product of the intersection of physics, mathematics, 

### computer science , and economics. Computational economists uses computer-based economic modeling 

### to analyze and help the government and industries to solve many complex economic probelms. Since for 

### some complex economic problems, theoretical analysis can not do anything, and similar experiments like 

### natural science can not be carried out. The development of economics calls  for the emergence of new 

### scientific research methods. The increased ability of computers to deal with bulky data has provided the 

### possibility for computing as a means of economic research. Nowadays, computer-based economic 

### analysis is ubiquitous in economic research and practice. 













### In genenral, there are 3 steps for computational economists to solve the economic problems:
  ### 1.  Mathmatical modeling
  ### 2.  Algorithm design - Coding - Show the numerical results;
  ### 3  Combining numerical results with theoretical analysis and practical experiences and  give an answer 
  
  ### to the actual problem or proposes the revision of the model.

### In my opinions, for the computational economists, they should place more attention on " how to become a 

### better algorithm designer', not just on writting some financial programs and get the numerical results.  

### Nowadays many financial computing problems have the following characteristics: high-dimensional, multi-

### scale, nonlinear, singularity, complex regions, not only need large-scale computing, but also require high 

### precision. Without a better algorithm design, the computing is not stable, the numerical economic results 

### are not credible and sometimes contains singularity. In addition, you may have runtime error and cause 

### your programes terminate abnormally. Such problems can not be solved even by the most powerful 

### computers today. Thus, for computational economists, they should do more algorithmic research and try 

### to devise the optimization algorithms to help the industries and government to solve economic problems 

### efficiently and correctly.
